[2020.11] ATS Practices Final Project : Displacement (Proposal)
<hr>
<h2>A Fictional OS For A Synthetic Universe</h2>
<hr>
<i>what?</i>
<p>for this project, i am intending to make a website that functions as a fictional operating system based in a synthetic universe of my creation. the interface will consist of seemingly abstract symbols which relate to the language i have created for this universe along with the imagery attatched to it. here is an example of this script used in a design i created earlier this year.</p>
<img src="../lexicon/media/images/290.png" width="50%">
<p>what i expect people to take away from this "OS" is that of a similar experience i get online every day, that being the act of exploring the homepages of artists/developers/etc which haven't been updated in years, often only accessible through the wayback machine. by having this be an "OS" as opposed to a "homepage" lies in the amount of interaction that would be allowed through the site, and how much the site itself can be personalized to suggest different kinds of users.</p>
<hr>
<i>why?</i>
<p>this is something i have been meaning to do for as long as i have been an artist. the idea of an operating system as a place that reflects reality was always very fascinating to me.</p>
<hr>
<i>how?</i>
<p>this website will be made with just html and p5js in mind, with a minimalist approach to the ui but a maximalist and esoteric approach to the "applications".</p>
