[2020.11] ATS Practices Final Project : Displacement (Proposal)
<hr>
<h2>A Fictional OS For A Synthetic Universe</h2>
<hr>
<i>what?</i>
<p>for this project, i am intending to make a website that functions as a fictional operating system based in a synthetic universe of my creation. the interface will consist of seemingly abstract symbols which relate to the language i have created for this universe along with the imagery attatched to it. here is an example of this script used in a design i created earlier this year:</p>

<p>i am thinking of displacement in this through how the fictional OS feels "displaced" from our own reality, yet still functional to a certain extent. this displacement allows a person to learn more about a theoretical individual by discovering how the OS itself works.</p>
<hr>
<i>why?</i>
<p>this is something i have been meaning to do for as long as i have been an artist. the idea of an operating system as a place that reflects the reality of a person was always very fascinating to me.</p>
<p>for the site itself i am taking inspiration from many different things. some of these include experimental music notation, in how it tries to map "linear" information as if it were like a circuit. i find this interesting for the purpose of an OS as it could represent how applications work as part of daily workflow, or routine. here is one example:</p>

<p>another aesthetic influence would be various operating systems built for incredibly specific and technical purposes where every element of the ui references external hardware, such as this control interface for the Soyuz spacecraft:</p>

<p>and finally, this one short devlog video for a game that never left the prototype stage has always intrigued me a lot since when i was very young. the transition to it from the ios environment by comparison adds to the immersion i think, and i would want my "OS" to feel similar when being used.</p>

<p>what i expect people to take away from this "OS" is that of a similar experience i get online every day, that being the act of exploring the homepages of artists/developers/etc which haven't been updated in years, often only accessible through the wayback machine. by having this be an "OS" as opposed to a "homepage" lies in the amount of interaction that would be allowed through the site, and how much the site itself can be personalized to suggest different kinds of users.</p>
<hr>
<i>how?</i>
<p>this website will be made with just html and p5js in mind, with a minimalist approach to the ui. i wouldn't have any materials in mind other than just a device with a screen, i intend for the site to work on both mobile and desktop. timeline wise, i can see myself completing this over the course of a few days but with heavy planning beforehand which might take another day or two. i am thinking of making this something of a prototype itself for an even larger project, but self-contained enough to not fall under its own ambitious weight. the os will probably have a script illustration program as a sort of messanger, a radio program that involves creating audio, and a few databases for reference of this universe itself.</p>
