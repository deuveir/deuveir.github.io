[2020.11] Research Studio I : Print Project (Proposal)
<hr>
<h2>A Fictional Reference Guide for Cataloging a Synthetic Universe</h2>
<hr>
<b>what?</b>
<p>for this project, i am intending to make a consolidated book that documents my art through the context of the universe which i create it for. since i have a lot of output, i am thinking of keeping it to specific categories rather than as a whole retrospective.</p>
<p>i currently don't have any proofs of this idea, but i do have art which i have created for it / might be incorporated into it. here are a few examples:</p>

<hr>
<b>why?</b>
<p>this is something i have been meaning to do for as long as i have been an artist. the idea of a book from outside my current reality has always fascinated me, and i have collected books over my life which give me this feeling. below are a few of those books:</p>
<u>a dictionary of color combinations</u>

<p>i think the information to be found in the "real world" is infinite in its beauty and complexity, but is inherently hard to comprehend. this is one reason why i want to create ficional worlds as for them to re contextualize the real world as something to explore.</p>
<hr>
<b>how?</b>
<p>this book will be a single physical object as to suggest it can be "relied" on as opposed to a collection of documents and ephemera to explore. it would be small and almost pocket-sized too, to suggest portability. i would design this book most likely in just html, as the formatting will be very simple. from the html sites i will export a pdf which will be sent to print as a physical book.</p>
