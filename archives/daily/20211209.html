showcase for playdead
<hr>
below i will showcase various works i've done which i feel are relavent to playdead in a cronological fashion!
<hr>
first, here are some recordings from a vr game i've been working on, initially tested through vrchat. almost everything here is made just in-engine, without importing new models. I've included multiple videos even though they are pretty much of the same thing just to show the various stages it had in visuals and details:

results still have a lot to be desired, as it was fragmented into multiple unity scenes with different approaches, all a result of a lot of experimentation. the main thing i learned was that my process to create the entire maps using a seperate software and importing into unity was very difficult to get working, especially relating to locomotion and lighting. i think the best way to do it would to be like the version i am submitting, and even then it still wasn't perfect (had to get it to run using vrchat rather than as a regular package like i wanted because it wouldn't run with the plugins i had installed / tried to work with the map without being buggy). this version worked better still, as the map was made mostly in-engine with some models imported.
