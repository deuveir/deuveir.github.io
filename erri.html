				Erri is an organic sector containing an extensive variety of organisms and flora, all of which are as primitive as the continent itself. Erri contains many runoff cities from Ocith, as well as a number of small towns scattered about the sector. One of the most populated areas in Erri is Lamell, a city built on stilts and discarded machinery.

			</p>

			<p>

				Erri is geologically full of hills that increase in size and quantity the farther one reaches the center, creating a fractal formation. Erri has been subject to many experiments from origin-era Scientists, and due to this has various artifacts left astern. As one reaches the edge of the sector, the hills would begin sinking into the foggy clear rivers that separate it from Ocith.

				Lamell is a runoff city from Ocith, and contains many artisans and merchants, as well as a constantly shifting nomadic population. Lamell is built on stilts and forgotten machinery left behind by Scientists in the First Verse.

				The palette of Erri describes an outside world that feels interior. A lost childhood spent confined within dreams, familiar with a soft alienation that feels both safe yet abstract. The oblivion stands in front of you, but the space between innocence and perversion is stronger. The smell of lemongrass, eternal dusk, there is nothing other than here and the distance.
