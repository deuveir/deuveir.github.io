				Loire is a desert sector with a diverse array of citadel architecture. It is here that one can find the Miroire, an important site to the studies of Vaneakeu's Muln. Along the shores of Loire lies Jesalt, the city of the spires.

			<p>

				Loire's flora is sparse, but most are very solid and turbid in structure, lasting for many intervals.

				Jesalt is a city of monolithic structures along the coast of Loire, situated near the the mountains of Desult. Most of the architecture is inspired from the Areuvelian stations left behind by Scientists, but modified to be more residential. At the highest point one could only observe white and the immobile grey structures of the city. Many of the buildings are made to be modular and can move on their own to construct different arrangements for the shifting communities living in them.

				The Miroire is an immortal spherical structure that reflects interpretations of Muln through the eyes of the observer. It is in some ways similar to the starfield at the deepest point of the Soen Abyss, however this mirror is harmless to those not deemed a Scientist nor Tilonist. If one were to pass through the Miroire, they would experience a library of all language, represented as a linear gel-like tube where direction is only controlled by interest. Many have lost themselves in this library searching for an explanation to the Tilonist speak, but alas have been lost in its path for eternity as words cannot describe it.
