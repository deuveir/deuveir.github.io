				The Crux is a shining city existing as a single aleph present in all iterations and verses of Vaneakeu. It is populated with the immortal <a href="./tilonists">Tilonists</a>, staring into time as it redos itself for eternity. The exterior of the Crux appears as a sphere of mirrors which reflect the interpretations of its interior subjective to the observer. It is not unlike <a href="./dulon">Dulon</a> in this sense, as well as any other Mulnic artifacts. The interior experienced by Tilonists cannot be described with language other than their own, as it is simply too beautiful for words. One can only understand it if they were a Tilonist themselves.

				To light the sectors of <a href="./sectors">Adelos</a>, the Crux wears a series of surrounding "halos" that conceal most of its surface. Each of these "halos" rotate periodically, letting rays of light flush out from behind. This rotation is what defines an Interval. One halo is meant to represent an individual "waking" <a href="./tilonist">Tilonist</a>, and eventually once all of the Tilonists "sleep" no halos will be left. A fully shining Crux is what initiates the final verse.

			</p>

			<p>

				It is believed that the city the Crux contains does not actually experience any form of passage of time at all, and instead is a single moment of pure Muln that has "dried up" in the fabrics of Vaneakeu. In this interpretation, Tilonists become projections of a now sentient oblivion. They speak in the tongue of the <a href="./scientist">Scientist</a>'s own hubris and because of so realize the <a href="./areuvel">Essen</a> collapse as a true success.
