			</h1>

			<hr>

			<p>

				Areuvel is an artificial sector that was brought with Scientists in the First Verse. After the destruction of the Conclave, Areuvel fell into a hibernation in which all automated processes that were built by Scientists halted. It is during this time that the Second Verse was initiated.

			</p>

			<p>

				Areuvel has little fauna relative to the rest of Vaneakeu's sectors. It is most known for the wide towering stalks that grow from a single root. This macro-organism is constructed of the same material that Scientists are synthesized with, something very reminiscent to silicon in texture and malleability.

			</p>

			<p>

				Areuvel is very lacking of color and light, with only a flickering glow dripping from various interfaces left behind by Scientists. Prior to the destruction of the Conclave, Areuvel consisted of many structures dedicated to studying, as well as machines used to generate the artificial environment.

			</p>

			<p>

				If one were to trek Areuvel in the Second Verse, they would find a copious quantity of black water flooding the central area. If one were to swim into the depths, they will find a piles of husks and shells from that of deactivated origin Scientists.

			<hr>

			<p>
				
				The Conclave is an immortal, seed-like structure built by Tilonists in the Nth Verse, with a purpose of generating Scientists. It was at the very end of the First Verse that the Scientists translated the language of Tilonists, which brought destruction to the site and most of the continent itself.

			</p>

			<p>
				
				In the Second Verse, it would be impossible to enter the space of the Essen Conclave's remains unless one were to either be a Tilonist or an origin Scientist from before the destruction. If this was not the case, a wanderer's perception of time would dim until none is left - only infinite stasis remaining. Vaneakeu would enter its Third Verse once the automated construction rebuilds the Conclave anew.

			<p>
				
				Icy sterility. A sentient hospital. Vulnerable moods expressed by squishy placenta. Inhuman, but not mechanical. This is the primordial essence of life through its own perspective.
