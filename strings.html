					<li>Simulated universe that is from a “primordial future” / archived subjective reality</li>
					<li>Takes form as an array of servers throughout earth with similarities to monoliths initiating humans</li>
					<li>Aesthetics derived from my favorite shows and games at the time like the digital world in Code Lyoko or Half Life 2’s Synths, but far more specific in blending artificial and organic designs to a point there is very little that is recognizable in design/environments/creatures/etc.</li>
					<li>Significant influence in structure from my dreams at the time which were written in journals.</li>

					neon apophenia painting ideas:
					<li>the residual valley of deletionism: a piece that the artist recursively adds to every 5 minutes with what they had in the previous 5 minutes, a digital collage of illustrated debris</li>
					<li>the perception of the tamer and their beast: a piece which documents the job of the observer and their place in the symbolic eclipse diagram. combines 3d and 2d elements to create a sort of planetarium visual of a 3d individual (tamer) in a sphere looking at a 2d painter of a “beast” dissected in all the ways this tamer might approach it</li>

					if the leading factor of those who consistently make significant progress in what they live for is that of a locked stream constantly generating inspiration, i wonder if "inspiration" as a need for the culture of modern humans could be inverted or replaced with something that contradicts itself. as in like - generalizing humanity as in constant need to some form of "inspiration" to be set out to find and use to complete any type of mental desire...so then trying to build a new culture for humans disconnected from any previous to their birth where illusions and tulpas of "inspiration" are inserted into their new society which instead focus on the opposite of conscience but instead of growing wise as a general construct in discovering more about "the self at its origin in spectrum to others" (aka becoming more of a self aware mental thought machine that does it's best to accept sadness in the most useful way it would of been in most dramatic experiences of life)
