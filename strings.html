					in this world, children are born physically as capable fetuses which sometimes can resemble a flesh spinal cord isopod. when children are born they possess a physical spirit working with their body in synchronization with their pure ideals and outlook on the world. form is not coherent for them, but as the children grow through adolescence their bodies more resemble typical humanoids. however, they still possess energy from the spirit as it grows with them. eventually the spirit is disconnected entirely with the body of the humanoid and exists in its own mirror spirit realm experiencing some similar mental state and whatever it was possessing. these are like literal “tulpas” that have been existing in the humanoid society for as long as there was written history of them. these spirit tulpas all sport unique designs and forms describing their incarnate state, which when the fetus children are growing up can shapeshift into at any time. it is very rare to see those still have their childhood tulpa abilities remaining as they grow into adulthood but are mostly taken care of in conspiracy systems which concentrate those groups of people into experiencing simulated sub-realities. this all changes when one individual, in their early 30s, is revealed to have somehow taken the tulpas of thousands of children into himself collecting such a strong force and set of abilities to invoke an apocalyptic-like event that would have the world be reset into living in tandem with the spirit tulpa word permanently. as this individual is revealed, more and more people begin fighting for this new cause to live in a literal fantasy with their youthful self forever and become a follower. political and societal chaos ensues. the protagonist of this story is a 13-year old humanoid with the ability of physical regeneration. their tulpa is a cute, seed-like being with a single large eye poking out from the inside. they are set into a form of government child army which has been concealed by aesthetics and location, and begin their fight against the force of dimensional collapse.

					<li>Aesthetics derived from my favorite shows and games at the time like the digital world in Code Lyoko or Half Life 2’s Synths, but far more specific in blending artificial and organic designs to a point there is very little that is recognizable in design/environments/creatures/etc.</li>
					<li>Significant influence in structure from my dreams at the time which were written in journals.</li>

					neon apophenia painting ideas:
					<li>the residual valley of deletionism: a piece that the artist recursively adds to every 5 minutes with what they had in the previous 5 minutes, a digital collage of illustrated debris</li>
					<li>the perception of the tamer and their beast: a piece which documents the job of the observer and their place in the symbolic eclipse diagram. combines 3d and 2d elements to create a sort of planetarium visual of a 3d individual (tamer) in a sphere looking at a 2d painter of a “beast” dissected in all the ways this tamer might approach it</li>

					if the leading factor of those who consistently make significant progress in what they live for is that of a locked stream constantly generating inspiration, i wonder if "inspiration" as a need for the culture of modern humans could be inverted or replaced with something that contradicts itself. as in like - generalizing humanity as in constant need to some form of "inspiration" to be set out to find and use to complete any type of mental desire...so then trying to build a new culture for humans disconnected from any previous to their birth where illusions and tulpas of "inspiration" are inserted into their new society which instead focus on the opposite of conscience but instead of growing wise as a general construct in discovering more about "the self at its origin in spectrum to others" (aka becoming more of a self aware mental thought machine that does it's best to accept sadness in the most useful way it would of been in most dramatic experiences of life)

					<li>the world was still constructed enough to contain “sectors” or “biomes”, like narratives pass through it</li> 
					<li>monsters were strings that had properties related to how they are formed</li>
					<li>one example being strings that wrap around people then wrap through another dimension at the same time causing those inside to evaporate</li>
					<li>similar to earth but to much more of an extreme</li>
					<li>an example being how deserts contain an incredible amount of ruined civilization as deserts are holding all possible ruined civilizations around the world and time</li>
					<li>if one passes around the globe multiple times a black sea will eventually come only too them in the distance, which is a massive organism that stretches for continents and has a constant red sky</li>
					<li>there lies many futuristic developments in the black sea to those that have mastered it, revealing futuristic sterile rooms that turn invisible and then to antarctice-like base establishments with cryptic design</li>
					<li>past the black sea is mostly unknown, but it could either lead back to the start of history or to the game-world of string beings.</li>
