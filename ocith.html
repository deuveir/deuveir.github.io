				Ocith is a massive, circular industrial sector that faces Soen in the Vaneakeu dyson sphere. It was constructed through the first verse by Scientists in order to generate energy, and primarily was another circular ocean titled Eson. Ocith is known most for its cylindrical towers that extend from the deepest layers of the continent. Ocith, despite its size, does not have a society run by anything material. It is operated entirely by Nouvion, an AI that can shift the continent in order to express its ego. Nouvion was initially constructed in the center of the city's deepest point for mechanical organization, but after much integration through the second verse it now exists in every element of the city.

				In the spaces between the cylindrical towers lies many small communities and nests. Located in the deeper layers similar places can be found, but have since been abandoned due to Nouvion's control. The interior of these towers are most of the same, however many contain machinery under the influence of Nouvion. These machines construct artificial nutrients and tools needed for citizens of the Ocith, and in turn the citizens would feed the machines organic materials from various sources to keep them active. One of the primary communities in Ocith is Hivon, and takes up a quarter of the sector area.
