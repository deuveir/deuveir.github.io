				Soen is a circular ocean perpendicular to Ocith. The surface of Soen is a vast sea housing nomadic stations which drift about. Of these stations contains the significant nomadic city of Vosel. Below the surface lies an entirely different aquatic landscape, known as the Abyss. Turbines are a common and important architectural trope of this landscape as they generate power from winds produced by the halos of the Crux.

			</p>

			<p>

				No matter the shore of which Soen touches, the ocean fashions either a pale white or a luminous cyan. These colors change depending on Vaneakeu's current interval and are done so by the microscopic solites. During periods where the ocean is cyan, the upper layers become populated with a diverse array of life. During periods where the ocean is pale, most of these creatures migrate deeper into the Abyss for hibernation.

				Vosel is a nomadic city that drifts in a circular orbit around Keu. This city has no natives, there are only immigrants. Most of Vosel's architectural style (that isn't already a population of vessels) is constructed with a concrete-like material naturally produced from the shells of Solites which have floated up from the Abyss. After enough time, coral and barnacle-like structures begin to form on architecture made with this material. In Vosel these natural structures are often kept, as it is wise to display longevity in such a distant location.

				The Circulatory is a series of interconnected structures scattered around Soen and act as miniature cities to maintain the magnetic transit system of the same name.

				Keu, where Vaneakeu derives part of its name, is the central island of Soen and the only location an Immortal could be seen other than the Crux. There can be an infinite amount of inhabitants on the island, as it is in a space only accessible to those who were afflicted with a minor understanding of Tilon. These inhabitants shift through Vaneakeu's intervals and verses unless constricted to a dimension where time does not follow a linear progression, hence the function of Keu. At the center of Keu is a spire that extends into the Crux, and was constructed by the Tilonists in the Nth Verse of Vaneakeu's history.

				The Soen Abyss has a depth which penetrates past Vaneakeu's boundary into the nullspace of Muln. It is separated into 8 layers, each of which contain their own environmental features and organisms.

			</p>

			<p>
				
				At the base of the abyss, one would see an ordered starfield of infinite reflections. If this observer was not a Scientist or an Immortal, they would be immediately spat into a random sector of Dulon.

				The palette of Soen states that Blue is static. Hope is in constant motion, and it is unclear if the water has infected the sky yet.
