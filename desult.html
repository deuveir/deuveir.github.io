			</h1>

			<hr>

			<p>

				Desult is a sector of two contrasting layers. The surface is a very hostile environment while the underground is a very welcoming one, albeit mysterious. Fog seeps through the surface environment, in turn warping distance. The highest point is known as Neriel. There are no major cities in Desult, however the underground passageways of Impudelon and Inquilt act as the sector's universal shelter.


			</p>

			<p>

				The surface of Desult is dim and silent from fog. This is due to emissions from nearby Ocithian machinery which are directed towards the edges of Desult's continent. To keep those from accessing Ocith in this vulnerable point for the city, massive Domestic Striders safeguard the machines. These striders are incredibly dangerous and nearly omniscient to the point that leaving the confines of Inquilt and Impudelon is considered a death wish.

				Neriel is a singular mountain at the center of Desult's continent. Neriel leads to the second highest point in Vaneakeu, only beaten by the artificial spire of Keu. If one reaches the summit, of which penetrates the Ocithian fog, they would be able to see the reflections of the Crux. The tip of this mountain is split and has ethereal harmonies flow through the gap in between.

				Impudelon and Inquilt are a series of underground catacombs constructed by wanderers in the end of the first Verse and through the second. It was originally used to maneuver or shelter those from the surface, but as intervals passed it became a city in of itself made entirely of corridors. Inquilt offers a constant warm temperature along with pockets to rest and live, while Impudelon consists of seemingly infinite marketplaces stacked in and out of each other.

				The palette of Desult, primarily its underground world, describes an inside world that feels exterior. Security in a mechanized toybox. Lucid corridors and nostalgic mysteries. The amnesic heaven in our dreams.
